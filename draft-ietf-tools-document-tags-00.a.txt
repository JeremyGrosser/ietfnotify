Abstract

   The IETF currently names some of its working documents (drafts) and
   final documents (RFCs) using unique tags.  These tags constitute a
   means of identifying an IETF document and its precise content
   uniquely, not only at a certain time, but also over time.  This
   document proposes to extend this system, so it is applied to more
   types of IETF documents; in particular to agendas, charters, minutes,
   mailing-list messages and reviews; but also to other document types.

Internet-Draft             IETF Document Tags                   May 2006


1.  Introduction

   The practice of having unique tags for the documents which are
   handled by the IETF has proven useful over time.  When referring to a
   certain internet-draft by its tag, which indicates document type,
   name, and revision, the document and its content is uniquely
   identified, and can be referred to and discussed with the valid
   assumption that anybody interested in the document can retrieve it
   from a local store, or from somewhere on the internet.

   Many other documents (in a wide sense) that are used or referred to
   in daily IETF work do not have such unique tags, but can only be
   referred to by URLs, and sometimes not even by that.  Now, a URL as a
   document identifier is extremely useful in the context of retrieving
   a document if you have internet access, but it does not guarantee
   immutability of content or ability to refer to a document
   irrespective of its location.  This document proposes to establish a
   set of document tags for a number of document types (in a wide sense)
   which do not today have any unique tags associated with them.


2.  Tag design

   The power of IETF document tags to uniquely identify document content
   rests on three basic premises:

   1.  The document tag uniquely identifies the type of document: a tag
       starting with the string 'draft-' identifies an internet-draft,
       while a tag starting with the string 'RFC' or 'rfc' identifies a
       published IETF RFC.

       This makes the namespaces of the different document types non-
       overlapping, thus guaranteeing that tag uniqueness within a
       document type guarantees tag uniqueness over all IETF documents.

   2.  The document tag (excluding revision number) is unique to a given
       IETF document type: no other document of that type will ever be
       given the same tag as a previous document.  For this to hold,
       some mechanism to ensure the uniqueness is needed; one way is to
       verify uniqueness at the time of submission of the document to a
       document repository.

       This provides tag uniqueness within a document type.

   3.  Once a document is made public, its content is never changed.
       New revisions of a draft are given a new unique tag by
       incrementing the revision number part of the tag.  Revisions of
       RFCs are issued a completely new RFC number.

       This guarantees that a certain document content is uniquely
       identified by its document tag, irrespective of the date and time
       at which it is looked up.

   In creating new document tags, we should take care to ensure that
   also the new tags will have the same qualities as the current tags,
   as listed above.  This requires both that the tag format be
   appropriately designed, and that appropriate mechanisms for ensuring
   uniqueness of assigned tags are provided, as well as providing
   storage mechanisms which make it possible to retrieve a document by
   means of its unique tag.

   In some cases, the relevant documents are already today stored so
   that they can be uniquely retrieved by performing some (possibly
   obscure) resolution algorithm, followed by a HTTP or FTP request to
   the appropriate URL.  In other cases, new storage and / or procedures
   are required.  Charters, for instance, are not readily available
   other than in the 'current' revision; and reviews are not available
   from any repository at all.


3.  New document types

   This section describes new tag types for a number of existing
   document types.  Document types is here meant in a wide sense,
   covering also for instance IETF mailing list messages and IESG
   discusses.  The document types covered are:

   *  Agendas

   *  Minutes

   *  Charters

   *  Discusses

   *  Guidelines

   *  List messages

   *  Reviews

   *  Issues

   *  Wiki Pages

   In general, all the proposed new tag types start with a unique text
   string followed by a dash; this is the same concept used by internet-

   draft tags which always start with 'draft-'.

   Below you'll find a table giving examples of the proposed tag
   formats.  The examples assume a working group called xxwg, a draft
   with tag draft-ietf-xxwg-subj-trans-06, a reviewer with the email
   reviewer@example.org and an area director with email address
   ad.name@example.org .  In the next section we will describe the
   proposed tags in more detail.

3.1.  Agendas

   Each IETF meeting has a unique meeting number and an overall
   published agenda.  Many of the working-group meetings held during an
   IETF also has their own published agenda.

Internet-Draft             IETF Document Tags                   May 2006


   Where the individual working group agenda tags have the working group
   acronym as a part of the tag, the overall ietf agenda instead uses
   the acronym 'ietf' instead.

      Tag components:

      prefix          "agenda-"

      meeting number  The IETF meeting number during which the working
                      group meeting occurred.  For interim meetings, the
                      nearest previous meeting number with an appended
                      lowercase letter is used, with the letter for the
                      first interim meeting being 'a', for the second
                      'b', and so on alphabetically.

      working group   The acronym of the working group.

      revision        Two-digit revision number, starting at 00.

   Example: A meeting of the working group xxwg during IETF 65 would
   have an agenda with the tag agenda-65-xxwg, so the second version of
   the agenda would be agenda-65-xxwg-01.  An interim meeting following
   this, but before IETF 66 would have an agenda where the first version
   was agenda-65a-xxwg-00.

   Example: The overall agenda for IETF 65, if it was published in 4
   different revisions, would have the tags agenda-65-ietf-00, agenda-
   65-ietf-01, agenda-65-ietf-02 and agenda-65-ietf-03.

   The document tags proposed in this document should maybe also have
   corresponding formalised URN forms under the 'ietf' URN namespace RFC
   2648 [RFC2648].  This document does not, however, propose that this
   formalisation be done, only that the unique document tags and
   associated document storage be put into use within the IETF.
